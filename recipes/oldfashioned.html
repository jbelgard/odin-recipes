    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When you get right down to it, the bourbon Old Fashioned is little more than a slug of whiskey, seasoned and sweetened.  Yet the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkers' hearts 200 years ago.</p>
    <p>If you're a history buff, you could draw a straight line connecting this drink to the first recorded definition of the cocktail category in general, which called for spirits, sugar, water and bitters.</p>
